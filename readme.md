# Mortgage Default Prediction Using Feature Engineering and Baseline Models  
This project applies **data cleaning**, **feature engineering**, and **supervised learning** to model the probability that a borrower will default on a mortgage loan.

The dataset is prepared by handling **missing values**, **binning skewed continuous variables**, and applying **smoothed target encoding** to categorical fields. After transforming the data, we train two baseline models—**Decision Tree** and **Logistic Regression**—to estimate default risk.

Model performance is evaluated using industry-standard metrics, including **accuracy**, **confusion matrices**, **ROC/AUC**, **precision–recall curves**, **gains tables**, and the **KS statistic**, allowing us to compare each model’s ability to distinguish high-risk from low-risk borrowers.
